> fun filled days for the family - helping parents fill kids days

This is a submission to the [First Ireland's 18h Open Data Challenge](http://www.inventorium.org/events)_  

Do you have kids? You want to spend value time with your family? Now, do you know what is happening and where? What about the costs? And, how does the weather play into it?

family fun is a cross-platform mobile device app that informs parents what is happening near them, see also the [planning GDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRg0JNQ_Z0w-Xc-NNWgAGkLBwY9Na2_xA2aOkQebDY0/edit).
